This is my project of DataBase subject. In this project I have created fake data lists. The data was filled by using Faker and later saved in CSV files as games.csv, players.csv and reviews.csv.

games.csv contains such columns as game_id, title, genre, release_date;

players.csv contains such columns as player_id, nickname, email;

reviews.csv contains such coulumns as review_id, game_id, player_id, mark, review_date;



The purpose of this project is to compare each database's speed by giving same query with equal difficulty. 

The results can be seen in MS Word file "DB_Report"

Each folder contains a code for each database corresponding to the name of the folder
